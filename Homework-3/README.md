1. Write and test a MIPS assembly program to compute the first 200 prime numbers. You should implement four procedures:

   i. is_prime(n), this procedure returns 1 if  n is prime and 0 if n  is not prime.  

   ii. main (), this procedure iterates over the integers and tests if  each one is prime or not. This procedure must call is_prime.
   
   iii. check_prime(n): this procedure returns 1 if a prime number  is between 199 and 299 and 0 otherwise.
   
   iv. print_int, this procedure prints an integer number.
 

Print all the prime numbers between 199 and 299.
